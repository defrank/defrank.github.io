      Readz is a website creation platform similar to Wix.  Built for
      designers that do not want templates, but the freedom to build
      anything they want an absolutely positioned, drag-and-drop,
      WYSIWYG editor.
  role: >
      Full-stack software development with a focus on infrastructure
      and internal tools.
  technologies:
      - "Python 2.7"
      - "Django 1.8"
      - "Javascript"
      - "HTML5"
      - "CSS3"
      - "MySQL"
      - "Apache 2"
      - "Git"
      - "AWS"
      - "Akamai"
      - "BottlePy"
      - "SQLite 3"
      - "PhantomJS"
      - "Bash"
      - "Linux"
  responsibilities:
      - Streamlined testing environments by creating a server that
        pulls new code from GitHub to create new hosts.  Included a web
        interface for specifying Git branches to watch.
      - Improved pre-release bug detection of customer content by
        building an application with PhantomJS2 to compare production
        content with current the development version.
      - This reduced QA time spent verifying hundreds of customer
        websites every sprint (i.e., two weeks).
      - Improved quality assurance by adding unit tests to the
        codebase.  Added functionality to the previously mentioned test
        server to fail if unit tests fail.
      - Designed and implemented API wrapper for easily automating
        updating configuration to the Akamai CDN using their
        <a href="https://developer.akamai.com/api/luna/papi/overview.html" target="_blank">
        Property Manager API</a>.
      - Increased bug awareness by configuring and adding logging
        mechanism to the server.  Errors in request handling, spawned
        threads, and cronjobs are emailed to developers.
